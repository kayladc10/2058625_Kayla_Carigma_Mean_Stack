    <h2 class="redbell">The Red Bell Pepper</h2>
    <img class="imgred" src="https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/red-bell-peppers-in-a-supermarket-in-gliwice-poland-on-april-19-2021-picture-id1232577560" /> 
    <p class="reddesc">Did anyone ever tell you that red bell peppers are actually an older version of green bell peppers? 
        They even have two times the amount of vitamin C as a green bell pepper!
        The longer they ripen, the sweeter they get, and WHO doesn't like that?!
        Red bell peppers are actually the sweetest of bell peppers and they are a plentiful source of vitamin A.
        Do you even know a better way to use a red bell pepper? Roasted and sliced inside of a panini sandwich!
        Go try some for yourself! You won't regret it!</p>

    <h2 class="greenbell">The Green Bell Pepper</h2>
    <img class="imggreen" src="https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/produce-market-peppers-and-cauliflower-picture-id1263632933" /> 
    <p class="greendesc">You should be aware that green bell peppers last longer than red and yellow bell peppers. 
        Think about that while you're at your next farmer's market trip!
        Green peppers are the most savory of the sweet bell peppers and they can even improve your eye health the same
        way carrots and eggs can! This is because of the chemical compound lutein. They also have double the amount of 
        vitamin C than any citrus fruit! Go green!
    </p>

    <h2 class="yellowbell">The Yellow Bell Pepper</h2>

    <p class="yellowdesc"> Let's move on now to the bright sensation of the yellow bell pepper folks.
        Although not as sweet as the red bell pepper, yellow bell peppers contain less calories than its healthier rival.
        Yellow bell peppers are an excellent source of-- you guessed it-- VITAMIN C as well as vitamin A, fiber, 
        potassium, iron and calcium. Normally, yellow bell peppers are commonly used when it comes to grilling, sauteing,
        roasting or just eating it plain raw, whatever suits your food ambition! You should also know that they are 
        native to the tropical parts of the Americas, so why not take a journey to experience the fresh pickings
        of a yellow bell pepper near the equator... or your local market to save the expenses.

    <h2 class="orangebell">The Orange Bell Pepper</h2>
    <img class="imgorange" src="https://image.shutterstock.com/image-photo/pile-ripe-bright-orange-color-600w-505792786.jpg" /> 
    <p class="orangedesc">We finally end on our final variety of the bell pepper, as far as I know, with the orange bell pepper 
        (just kidding there are much more that are quite obscure). Orange bell peppers do have a watery crunch to them
        and a lasting sweet and fruity flavor. It is an incredible source of vitamin A, C and B6, not to also mention
        folate, copper, maganese and potassium. Depending on where they are grown, orange bell peppers can be considered
        the sweeter bell pepper than a red bell pepper. Along with the yellow bell pepper, the orange bell pepper are rich 
        in carotenoids which are antioxidants that help in protecting you from disease and also enhances your immune system!
